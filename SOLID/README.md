## SOLID Principles

### **S**ingle Responsibility Principle  
    A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

### **O**pen/Close Principle  
    Software entities (e.g., classes) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### **L**iskov Substitution Principle
    Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

### **I**nterface Segregation Principle
    Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### **D**ependency Inversion Principle
    One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
